# Decision Index

## Discovery Status

This index is the current discovery surface for durable engineering decisions in this repository. Local Owner decisions `DEC-001`, `DEC-002`, `DEC-003`, `DEC-004`, `DEC-005`, `DEC-006`, and `DEC-007` are recorded and indexed with status `ACTIVE`. All six Owner decision gates for Product V1 are resolved, and `DEC-007` records the Owner approval of the architecture and the start of implementation.
