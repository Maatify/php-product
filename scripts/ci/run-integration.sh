# Canonical Integration orchestration (composer test / composer test:integration).
#
# Usage: scripts/ci/run-integration.sh [PHPUNIT_ARGUMENTS...]
# Environment:
#   PRODUCT_TEST_MYSQL_VERSION  MySQL image tag; default 8.0.16 (supported minimum)
#   PRODUCT_TEST_RUNS           repeat count against the same service; default 2
# Prerequisites: Docker with the Compose plugin, openssl, PHP with pdo_mysql, and
# `composer update` already run (vendor/bin/phpunit present).
#
# Lifecycle: validate prerequisites -> start the real MySQL service from the
# repository-owned docker-compose.yml -> wait for service-level health ->
# discover the loopback endpoint -> run the PHPUnit Integration suite (each test
# class installs schema/product.sql into its own fresh database) -> repeat ->
# check that no test database remains -> tear down with `down -v`, also on
# failure. Credentials are random, run-scoped, and never written to disk.
